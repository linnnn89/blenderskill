# 01 — Orchestration

**Open this when** the request spans multiple phases or skills, when two skills disagree about the same artifact, when the user has rejected a result and you need to diagnose *why* rather than retry blindly, or when you are driving the NIUA finisher MCP.

Paths below are relative to this file's own directory.

| Manual | Use when | Path |
|--------|----------|------|
| `blender-pro-workflow` | You need the end-to-end order for a complete scene/hero shot, critique protocols, time budgets, or a recovery pattern for a multi-phase job going wrong | `blender-pro-workflow/MANUAL.md` |
| `blender-skill-harmonizer` | Two or more skills want to act on the same artifact and you must decide precedence; or a task is reference-locked and needs handoff gates and a conflict policy | `blender-skill-harmonizer/MANUAL.md` |
| `quality-refinement-autoloop` | Output was rejected, the same issue keeps recurring, or the user asks to improve the skill stack before retrying. Diagnoses the gap, repairs the artifact or the skill, sanitizes the lesson, then resumes | `quality-refinement-autoloop/MANUAL.md` |
| `niua-blender-finisher` | Driving the NIUA Blender Finisher MCP (`blender-finisher`, `feedback-critique`, `feedback-capture`, `system-execute_python`, mesh observation) without exploding the token window | `niua-blender-finisher/MANUAL.md` |

## Not here

- The MCP transport itself (install, client wiring, port 9876, safe mode, connection troubleshooting) → the separate **`blender-mcp`** skill.
- Choosing a *look* for the scene → `10-art-direction/`.
