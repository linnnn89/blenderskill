# MCP Integration

The Blender MCP transport, install, client wiring, safe mode, telemetry, and connection troubleshooting live in the separate **`blender-mcp`** skill. Use that skill when the problem is the connection or the MCP surface.

The PyPI package was renamed from `blender-mcp` to **`mcp-for-blender`** (existing configs still work). Repo: `ahujasid/mcp-for-blender`.

## Core tools (always available)

| Tool | Purpose | Key parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `mcp__blender__execute_blender_code` | Run Python code inside Blender | `code` (string) |
| `mcp__blender__get_scene_info` | Scene overview: objects, materials, lights, cameras | — |
| `mcp__blender__get_object_info` | Detailed info for one object | `object_name` (string) |
| `mcp__blender__get_viewport_screenshot` | Capture the current 3D viewport | — |

Execution rules for generated Python: `${COMMANDCODE_SKILL_DIR}/references/code-execution-rules.md`.

## Asset download tools

### Poly Haven — HDRIs, textures, and models

Free CC0 library. Preferred source for production-quality environments, PBR textures, and pre-built models.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__blender__search_polyhaven_assets` | Search the Poly Haven catalog |
| `mcp__blender__download_polyhaven_asset` | Download and import an asset by slug |

**Key behaviours** (from addon source):
- **Models import from `.blend`** (lossless); glTF/FBX are lossy fallbacks used only when the `.blend` was authored in a newer Blender than the running version.
- **Textures** download only the maps that wire to Principled BSDF: Diffuse, Rough, Metal, Displacement, nor_gl. AO, spec, anisotropy maps are skipped to keep downloads small.
- **HDRIs** default to `.hdr` format; `.exr` also available.
- Timeouts: API 10s connect / 30s read; file downloads 10s / 60s.
- Search results capped at 20 (max 50).

**Typical usage:**
```python
# Search for a forest HDRI
mcp__blender__search_polyhaven_assets(query="forest", type="hdris")

# Download and apply
mcp__blender__download_polyhaven_asset(slug="forest_slope", type="hdris", resolution="2k")
```

### Sketchfab — Community 3D models

Large catalog of user-uploaded models. Requires API key for downloads.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__blender__search_sketchfab_models` | Search the Sketchfab catalog |
| `mcp__blender__download_sketchfab_model` | Download and import a model by UID |

**Notes:**
- API credentials can be set persistently in the addon preferences.
- Downloaded models may use non-Principled materials; rebuild if export is needed.

### Poly Pizza — Low-poly models

Curated low-poly / stylized models. Good for game assets and quick prototyping.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__blender__search_polypizza_models` | Search with optional category and licence filters |
| `mcp__blender__download_polypizza_model` | Download and import a model by ID |

**Known issue — Cloudflare CDN blocking:**
Poly Pizza's CDN (`static.poly.pizza`) uses Cloudflare bot protection. Downloads from datacenter/VPN/cloud IPs get a 403 HTML challenge instead of the GLB file. This is **not** an API key problem. Workarounds:
1. Retry from a residential IP connection.
2. Download the `.glb` manually from `https://poly.pizza` and import via File → Import → glTF 2.0.

**Category IDs** (0–11): passed as integers. Licence IDs: 0 = CC-BY, 1 = CC0.

## AI 3D generation tools

### Hyper3D Rodin — Text/image to 3D

Generate 3D models from text descriptions or reference images using the Rodin API.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__blender__generate_hyper3d_model_via_text` | Generate a 3D model from a text prompt |
| `mcp__blender__generate_hyper3d_model_via_image` | Generate a 3D model from a reference image |

**Notes:**
- Free trial available with key `vibecoding`.
- Results are stylized meshes, not production topology. Use as a starting point, then retopologize.
- API credentials can be stored persistently in addon preferences.

### Hunyuan3D — Tencent's 3D generation

Another AI model generation option.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__blender__generate_hunyuan3d_model` | Generate a 3D model via Hunyuan3D |

## When to use asset tools vs. manual modeling

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| User asks for a "human" / "character" / "face" | Use asset tools for a base mesh, then chain materials + lighting |
| Need realistic environment backdrop | Poly Haven HDRIs or models |
| Quick prototype / game jam style | Poly Pizza low-poly models |
| Specific branded/custom object | Manual modeling via `02-modeling/` manuals |
| "Make a 3D model from this description" | Try Hyper3D Rodin text-to-3D, then refine |

## Connection limits

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Max snapshot objects | 4000 | `MAX_SNAPSHOT_OBJECTS` in addon.py |
| Max snapshot selected | 1000 | `MAX_SNAPSHOT_SELECTED` in addon.py |
| Default port | 9876 | Configurable via `BLENDER_PORT` env var |
| Code execution timeout | 180 s | Per-call limit |
| Protocol version | 9 | `ADDON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` in addon.py |
